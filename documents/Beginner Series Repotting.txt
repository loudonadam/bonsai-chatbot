Thus far in the creation of Josh's trees we've gone through the cleaning process the selection of front and the analysis of design and the application of structural wire and now we hit this pivotal time in the year the spring season to go about the repotting process we'll come back to the secondary tertiary wiring but the repotting process is a specific operation that a tree can handle at one time of year and one time of year only and this is during the spring season as the buds are swelling before the tree starts to grow but before we get to the repotting process let's first set that fundamental tone of why would we be repotting number one we need to repot when we've got so many roots in this really confined environment that we can't get water into the root system a tree needs a balance of water and oxygen to thrive and survive and if the container becomes so full of roots all of a sudden it's very difficult to give it the water that it needs to exist inside of that container number two sometimes our particles break down over the course of time as the tree acts on those particles and the conditions act on those particles and with that decomposition we have less oxygen in the container and we hold too much water and number three we need to repot and our reasons that josh is approaching his taxes today is to change the aesthetic to put it from a nursery container into a bonsai container and to maximize the visibility of this tree in its new environment that it's going to be cultivated in and shine with the aesthetic we create now that we understand why we would repot let's go through that process and really understand the step-by-step breakdown that we're going to be engaging with and letting josh explore today number one we've got to remove the tree from the container and this operation can be very delicate or can be quite easy depending on how established the root system is now if the tree is adhering to the exterior walls of the container we want to use a very fine chopstick or a serrated cutting blade to be able to cut the roots that are actually in contact with the wall of the nursery container or the bonsai pot to cleanly separate it so we can remove that tree from the container okay we don't need that space anymore I love that once free from the container now we start the process of actually teasing away the soil and changing the shape of that root mass to fit the new style and the container that we have conceptualized for the tree this means number one establishing the new angle of the tree on the bottom of the root mask just simply teasing away that soil without destroying the roots because we're going to still use these roots we're going to fold them down into the container once we've gone ahead and teased them the soil free of them and really loosen them up okay over the course of Josh's experience repotting his taxes I'm going to be kind of mirroring the process on my own on a boxwood right next to him and in the process of repotting the boxwood I'm going to be able to illustrate for Josh all of the techniques in that transitional process of conforming and sculpting that root system so I went down to the line okay that's good but you have to understand that the line exists from this base out okay so even this really compact area in here yeah I've been a little afraid to dig in there because it's pretty tight don't be afraid yeah I know I'm gonna I'm gonna just go for it see how I can just sort of kind of straighten those out a little bit now you see how they're going to lay down and then these pieces on top that have already been cut those are probably going to be pieces that we get rid of but I want this to be completely clear by the time we're done after we establish that angle we're going to start to remove any pieces of the root system that are sticking out of the container as a result of that aesthetic change so I'm just taking off some of these dryer or these less fine coarser upper surface roots or anything sticking straight up notice that I'm preserving kind of this thick piece here it clearly is connected to some substantial roots so I'm not going to cut that I'm going to use that as a feature of the tree can you roots getting dry at all a little bit yeah you're just getting a little bit of hydration okay and now here's the next thing right is now we've got to come to this bottom angle here and we've actually kind of compressed it to give you that position already but we need to be looking at that bottom angle that sets us up for a very flat nice new position with the tree so you're going to actually going to be laying this back where the branches don't touch coming back with that same fine piece and you're just going to be teasing this out to create a nice flat pad foreign the tree's roots have been worked the container's been selected and the soil composition has been decided if you want to see that container selection check out beginner series container selection video and if you want to learn more about the fundamental aspect of bonsai soils check out beginner series soils let's see how Josh does with these elements as we further the repotting process now that we've selected a container we can come back to this process of conforming the root system to actually give us the space around that native root mass to be able to open up the opportunity for soil to be inserted and new root growth to occur obviously in bonsai we have nuances that are specific to each species and when we talk about repotting a conifer a two-thirds reduction generally tends to be safe leaving that 30 of remaining root mass unharmed by scissors or the chopsticking process not too bad that looks nice we want to make sure that we've got the correct front of the pot chosen so notice that this is a little bit lighter here yeah as we rotate see how this band comes through it gets darker the lightness the diagonalness with a little bit of dark on this lower side trees moving to the right and then here we're sort of in that light phase less of that nuance but we do have these pieces this rough portion if it were me when we talk about delicate we talk about slender we think about light and I would probably be here as the front of my container yeah just when we were turning it around this felt this just aesthetically feels good yep okay in having selected the front so that we don't lose it I just mark it with a piece of chalk and now this is my front we're now going to prepare the container with drainage screens that cover the big holes in the bottom of the container so soil doesn't fall out and we're also going to set up our tie down wires that allow us to tie to the root system of the tree and secure it in the container so the tree does not move this point of strategizing our tie downs and accurately anchoring the tree in the container is what sets us up for success and we need to think hard about how we tie this tree into the container to make sure it's immobile so inside of that we see that we've got two holes here off to this side two holes here sort of on the front right and two holes here in the back now this tree wants to fall to the right side that means that we have to hold it on the left side okay so we automatically know we're and when we're holding it here if we bump this side it's going to want to fall back this way so that automatic means that we need a hold on this right side I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to Bridge that point right there so my tie down strategy knowing that I've got to hold it here from falling to the right that I've got to hold it here from what we call the rebound effect means I'm going to have one wire here one wire here and two wires here and my wire strategy is going to be one wire out of that hole and one wire out of that hole now I'm going to separate these because these are going to have different lengths going to different holes and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hold that angle right at the edge stretch it across and I'm going to put the fingernail of my finger right on the edge of that hole now that becomes my holding point to go ahead and create another really nice clean right angle okay so when we create that really beautiful clean angle and we put it into that hole it should lock into the corner of that hole and give us a maximum amount of stability and immobility okay so I'm going to do that for both of these wires and then I'm going to flip the container over and insert these into the hole foreign go straight to the wall and bend down if you're going to bend them out of the way to secure their position hey Josh come here and check this out so that you're ready to repot your taxes okay okay so I have my anchor wires in my container is prepped now we've got to set up our soil system now I've got two different sizes of soil that we're working with I've got what we call the aeration layer larger particle size same composition Akadama pumice lava I'm going to use one particle layer thick on the bottom of the container to increase oxygen content through the small holes that exist okay now these are the larger particles when you sift your bag of soil to get all the dust out that are going to be on your coarser screen and by putting just a single layer across the bottom we know that these are two big layers so we're going to go ahead and take a look at that super healthy roots but they do allow extra space to increase oxygen content that helps achieve that balance in the root system of the container and now we're going to put a single layer of our interior particle size that is going to cultivate the healthy roots and we know that we're going to be setting any tree that we repot as close to the bottom as possible because we're already reducing the root mass so much and putting it in this small pot means we need to value all of the space possible so you see that minimal mass first the larger particle for oxygen now the smaller particle to start to create that interface and cultivate healthy roots and then I'm going to set myself up with this central cone which when you settle the tree in is going to fill in all the gaps on the bottom of that root system and create that contact that gives us health over the course of time that central cone is where you're going to set your taxes settle it in fill all those spaces and have that good contact that facilitates that balance of water and oxygen so now that you've seen how I've gone about prepping this you can apply it to your plant to insert your taxes into a prepped soil condition cool all right see you later cool in terms of Josh's taxes and a coniferous need in the Bonsai container they need a good balance of water and oxygen that leans a little more on the oxygen heavy side we take that akadama that has that water holding capacity and we also add a little bit of pumice and a little bit of lava to it now with our broadleaf evergreens or deciduous like the boxwood I'm going to be using a soil medium that holds a little bit more water to satisfy that tree's need solid akadama is kind of the staple and the pillar that we utilize in the Bonsai practice to provide that water holding capacity for our broadleaf evergreen and deciduous species okay now this central mound when we set the tree in the container is what we're going to utilize to settle the tree down and into the container and get that up against the bottom of that root mass because we've got so many inconsistencies we've got a lot of undulations in the bottom depending on the drama of those undulations is what dictates the height of that cone yours is relatively flat so you don't need a big cone mine is really uneven I need a bigger cone to fill those spaces so when I set this tree in I'm going to set it in in the position that I want okay I don't want to sloppily set it in there and then try to fix it I want to make sure my container is squared up and watch how I settle okay so this side's a little low I want it up a little higher I'm going in here and just slide that soil underneath that to be able to establish that angle and really slide that akadama in and around and underneath that base maintaining the angle that we've established across the bottom of the root mass Josh is going to set that tree on the top of that cone holding that angle that he's striving for in the design of the tree and he's going to slowly rotate the root mass to settle that tree down into that cone and the particles into the bottom of his root system our wiring system is set up here so that we're just going to cross over the root mass here to hold that from falling that way okay now notice I'm going to pull to take up the slack and as I rotate I'm going to let that wire consume I'm going to let the rotation consume that slack okay now in doing so our tree is now holding its position and we're trying to hide this wire as much as we can so now we come back we just need one turn kept so I'm going to cut that nice and clean utilizing our interior soil and filling all of the negative space between the root mass and the edge of the container we're going to take our chopstick and just loosely fill those big open spaces to secure the tree in that position and start to integrate the soil into the root mass with those spaces that exist how am I really supposed to know when I'm done okay bulk filling this yeah so once you start going around and the soil stops dropping in as much okay so like right here it's not really dropping in as much that's when we know we've gotten an adequate bulk fill and we've gotten a lot of the negative spaces filled the detailed chop sticking process is probably the pivotal moment where we set the tree up for the greatest amount of health after the repotting process but these small spaces are still opportunities for the contact of the soil and the root to not necessarily be made and set the tree up in a direction it might not be able to thrive using a finer chopstick and maximizing our angle between the rim of the container and the bottom of the root mass we're going to be pushing soil into those spaces to really get that good contact on the finest level of our soil and the finest level of our roots meshing those two systems together and really building that system that allows us to establish a balance of water and oxygen and could I do you can make your own sounds okay guide your ear this is your Boneside practice the detailed chop sticking process should be systematic starting at one location moving all the way around the tree and returning to that initial starting location to make sure all spaces are filled see how the soil is going in yeah keep that soil coming feed it in feed it that hand is working yeah I'll have to try this again okay so you got you got White Knuckles yeah right you really got to relax you go in with force relax and now weight of your thumb throw your thumb at it see how you're pulling up roots yeah just to add soil with your scoop here always keep soil on top you can see that Josh and the detail chop sticking process is struggling a little bit and this feel is a real experience to build and understand when we've gone far enough or when we need to go further feel free to explore with this understand that this is a process we learn over time and know that just by being aware of filling those spaces with soil and improving the contact of the soil in the root even in your first try you will be improving the system and setting up a scenario where your tree is going to be healthy and successful okay so let's go ahead and check and give it a give it a yeah beautiful so when i drive in i don't break through that cusp right you can always drive into the root system you don't want this to be rock solid right and when i drive in here i feel nice contact i have to apply a significant amount of force you're done that's beautiful that's a beautiful job we've done so great to this point to pay attention to every detail let's not take our foot off the gas yet contouring the soil to leave ourselves an eighth to a quarter inch of space along the rim of the container and removing any roots that have come free over the course of the repotting process cleans up and contours that surface to maximize the aesthetic if you work so hard to show that base and to get down to that spread of the rootage then let's make sure that we see it okay and one of the apprehensions that a lot of beginners have is all these roots up here are they going to die well we're going to do something to protect those roots right but having soil on top of them will just wash away over the course of time we want to establish that and we want to see these different pieces of aesthetic we're going to use a top dressing of sphagnum and moss to be able to solidify that soil hold moisture in those surface roots and make sure that we create an environment that's favorable for the tree to grow sprinkling a light layer of top dressing over that solidifies those soil particles and ensures we're not going to destroy that aesthetic as we water the tree over the next months and years to come watering the tree in is the final step in repotting we're now in the recovery process and we're going to walk you guys through in the next beginner series episode how we water the tree to make sure we build that health so we can come back and take this tree down that next step of evolution congratulations on finding bonsai and digging into the process of learning
