Trident maple is one of these varieties of deciduous trees that in the bonsai practice is very dominant based on the fact that it has beautiful characteristics of a very broad thickening base, incredibly moving trunk with shedding bark, and a wonderful proportion to the branches that create the aesthetic that is a trident. It's one of the most vigorous deciduous species that we utilize. And inside of this vigor of the trident maple, we have to understand the processes that we apply to manage that vigor, to direct that strength distribution, and to achieve the finest ramification as we enhance this tree over the course of its development. The trident that we're working on is a tree that was created by Suthin in the eastern United States. It reached the pinnacle of its aesthetic and had overgrown the size of its canopy, reducing the strength and the impact of the base that is so prominent in such a focal point of trident maples. And And now we're in the process of building a secondary ramification to once again recreate the canopy that gives this tree all of its majestic aesthetic and value as a bonsai. At this time of year where the first flush and elongation of the growth has hardened off, we're rebuilding the branching structure of the secondary scaffolding. We don't want to be pinching over the course of the spring if we're getting elongation out of the secondary branches. But now that the tree's hardened off its first flush of growth, we need to go back in and set shape and structure to these smaller branches while they're still malleable and we can change their position. To enter this work, we need to decrease the leaf mass to better distribute the energy, move some of that strength into the lower and interior branches, and start to define that new shape of the secondary scaffolding that will build the ramification and really enhance the aesthetic of this tree. I start by removing the largest leaves first on a trident maple in the partial defoliation process. I'm looking to get down to those smallest leaves that exist and allow air and light to enter the interior of the tree. Once I have that partial defoliation on a branch complete, I can now start to analyze the structure of the secondary branches, prune back the vertically growing secondaries to the very first section of buds, and wire out those laterally growing secondaries to set that scaffolding, prune them back to direct the energy to the interior, and really start to redefine the shape of this tree on that secondary level. Obviously, throughout a tree that is being rebuilt after it's reached a pinnacle of its aesthetic and we're reducing its size to regain that proportion, some of the branches are going to have to be put back into development. Particularly in the rear of the tree, there are some slender branches that were weakened. But the tree is still growing. It's still growing. on the interior that have value in terms of their position i'm not going to be pruning these right now i want to let that first flush of growth really photosynthesize add to the sugar starch content increase the girth of the branch and build these pieces from a structural level to really integrate into the more established branching structure of the ultimate tree but along the rest of the back branches where i'm dealing with this same handling of re-establishing the secondary scaffolding i once again go back to the partial defoliation technique making sound pruning decisions on the vertically growing secondary branches that have emerged and i start to wire out the secondary branches that occur laterally to enhance that scaffolding once again any tree is going to start to show more strength in the apical region of the tree and a species like a trident that moves so many resources so rapidly in terms of water transpiring and the accumulation of sugar and starches from the photosynthetic process is naturally going to accumulate more leaf mass and more strength in the upper portion of the tree so as i move towards the apex i'm constantly considering how long do i want my secondary branches to be functional but not over shading the branches below them and how much do i want to defoliate the apical region of the tree to balance the density of the leaf mass again partial defoliation is a methodology where we remove the largest leaves to allow air and light to flow into the tree and the leaves are more likely to spread out to the interior of the tree but in removing this leaf mass in the areas that are denser we take those dense strong areas down to the same strength as our lower branches and we unify the distribution of energy to make sure that we have even growth across the entire tree partial defoliation wiring out of the secondary scaffolding and pruning backs of the tips to be really stimulating that interior ramified growth is exactly how we handle trident maple in a secondary build or a rebuild of the tree so that we have even growth across the entire tree and so that we have even growth across the entire tree and so that we have even growth across the entire tree process to maximize the quality of the tree and enhance that structure that will eventually lead to another pinnacle in this tree's aesthetic once we've rebuilt the secondary branching and scaffolding on this trident maple the process to maintain a trident maple is much the same as what you've witnessed we would be pinching the growth over the spring which would be a major deviation but when we reach this point of the first flush hardening off we still need to go in partially defoliate removing that structure and re-perfuse the base of the trident maple and relaxing the trees that long inner nodes to reduce coarser branching and to enhance continually that transition of taper from the very origin of that structural branch to the very refined tip of its ramification Trident maple are an incredible species to create bonsai with, and just by understanding how we distribute the strength, how we manage the production of the secondary scaffolding, and how we build the branching structure on a trident maple, you now have all the tools to be able to not only create, but also maintain your trident maples as a pivotal species and a wonderful example of the highest level of deciduous bonsai.
