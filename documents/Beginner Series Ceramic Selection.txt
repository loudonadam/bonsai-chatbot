container selection is a big conversation and for the purpose of keeping this simple for Josh I'm just gonna give him two possible options for his tree First was the stone monkey, which is this wonderfully beautiful reddish color that will complement the green foliage of the taxis Shallow to work with that slender trunk and has some visual interest in terms of the angularity of the container And now on the other side we had this Dave Georgie container very round in its nature Which might accommodate maybe an inability to reduce the root mass as far as we would like and handle a bit more depth It has a beautiful Texture and a real rugged rustic nature that works well with the bark colors of the taxis and still shows off that rich green color When we put each tree into the containers to see which one worked best We found that there were definitive aesthetic reasons to choose one over the other First we inserted the taxis into the stone monkey ceramic and immediately we recognize the container is too wide for the height of this tree Generally when we go with a shallow container and we expand the width We need to be dealing with a more vertically Significant tree a greater amount of height to really have this kind of a container execute the best aesthetic The red color worked as we thought wonderfully with the green But the shape as a whole did not show Josh's taxis well and in fact made the trunk look very small and under-impressive But when we put the taxes into the Dave Georgie We saw that deeper depth really enable us to accommodate the nursery root system that was being reduced and beyond that We saw the rugged nature of the texture And the subdued color allow the taxes to shine and really be the focal point of the composition The Dave Georgie was by far and away the best selection.
