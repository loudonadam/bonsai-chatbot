Tis the season to be maintaining our redwoods and this time of year for redwoods is so pivotal and important for the development and evolution as bonsai. When we've got all these fresh tips out in the spring, this is our opportunity. It's our opportunity to start the ramification process. It's our opportunity to start controlling the strength and evening out and balancing that strength across the tree. It's our opportunity to maintain all of these suckers that are growing off of the trunk. It's also our opportunity to begin building branch thickness and interior ramification. So when we start to look at redwoods at this time of year, when this new growth is very fresh, very soft and very easily pinched and removed from the tree, this is a time of year that we've got to be on top of redwoods to maximize their potential as bonsai. This is redwood growth management, not only to develop but also to refine. A very significant nuance of creating redwoods. Now when you look at this tree, you'll notice that the distribution of strength across this tree is very, very uniform for a redwood. One of the things we also need to say hand in hand before we go into the technique of how we pinch and maintain the growth of a redwood at this time of year is that we have yet to fertilize a redwood. Because if we fertilize the redwood, what starts to happen, stronger areas get stronger, weaker areas get weaker, and the growth becomes very coarse and unmanageable. If we're developing a redwood, maybe that's not the case. That would be an acceptable approach to take. Still pinching to develop, but fertilizing to get a more aggressive push of growth after that pinching operation. For this redwood in refinement, we hold off on fertilization until we pinch this very first time, and then we'll come back with lighter applications. So please apply that to the knowledge that we're going to be distributing to you today. So let's first and foremost just get a nuts and bolts idea of what pinching does for the redwood. When we take these softer pieces of growth, we always want to be leaving a small portion of the softer piece of growth when we pinch. A lot of times I'll support the very base of that soft piece of growth, and then I'll just be taking that terminal tip and simply removing it. Now when we look at the number of needles that we leave on a pinched process, there's two factors that dictate how many needles we leave or how much of that new growth we leave. Number one, we want to be pinching as tight to the silhouette as we possibly can, so that this tree doesn't get bigger and bigger and bigger every year. If we came into one of these new elongated pieces of growth and simply pinched off the very tip, I've just gotten almost an inch and a quarter of length that's going to be added to the silhouette of this tree. Over five, six years, an inch and a quarter, an inch and a quarter, an inch and a quarter, an inch and a quarter, and all of a sudden we've lost the size of the canopy that gives the impression of the shape of the tree and the value to the characteristics of the tree that we really are trying to maximize. So when we're maintaining an elongating species, and in particular a redwood in this case, and we're pinching that new growth, I'm going to come back to that same piece where I just pinched the tip. I'm going to be pinching this as tight as I possibly can while still maintaining some portion of that new growth. If we fully remove all of that new growth off of that tip, that tip will not produce another piece of new growth. We will get buds on the interior, but we lose the establishment of that silhouette that we're trying to maintain. So that's one idea about pinching. Now, if we're trying to elongate some of our branches, we're trying to develop that silhouette, we're trying to create interior ramification, we may be saying in some locations on the tree we don't want to be pinching that full length, and in pinching to the silhouette, or pinching to accomplish a component of design, we may literally just be pinching a small piece to stop the growth and transition the energy, but leaving more of that new growth because we want that length. So we've also got to be approaching this from the perspective that when we pinch a redwood to manage its growth and further enhance that refinement, we're not just pinching every growing tip on the tree the same way, as tight as we possibly can, we're pinching to accomplish shape, we're pinching to accomplish increased ramification, we're pinching and that increased ramification starts to build foliage mass that causes branch thickening. All of these things are a component of maintaining the growth at this time of year. So I'm going to take you into this branch, we're going to be pinching one branch at a time, looking at the process, talking about the strategy behind the development in that region, and you guys will see how we go about maintaining the growth, and in this totality of this redwood, you're seeing the fruits of five years of dedicated pinching over the spring season to get this uniformity of strength, to get this development of ramification, and to get to this level of refinement with Sequoia Sempervirens. So if we just blast into this initial lower pad, we've always got to be thinking in the design process, what am I trying to accomplish with this pad? For example, when we look over here at this pad off to the left of the design, a little bit of length in this pad is what gives direction. Even though we have a formal upright tree, in design, formal uprights still need to have an asymmetrical direction in a defining branch, and if it's this, I need to think very hard about how long I want that to be to maintain that flow and that movement in design. But if we come back to a more routine sort of interior space-filling detail branch, I'm going to be going ahead at this stage of this tree's development, and I'm going to be pinching all of these pieces of growth relatively tight because I don't want this branch to be any kind of significant design component. Now, when I start to look on the interior of this and I see some of these finer buds that exist, these aren't yet at a point. Where it's time to be pinching. We say that once these have elongated and we still have that very soft, fleshy growth before they harden, that is the point where we pinch. Now, via this pinching of these strong tips, that's where these interior pieces are going to elongate. Notice that this sits inside of these two longer pieces. This is going to elongate, and when we come back and pinch, we're going to be pinching to that silhouette. That's how we fill out sort of all of these spaces in the redwood branch. Okay? So, I'm going to be very discerning about what I'm pinching and how far I'm pinching it based on the maturity of that. Again, I have another weak piece here that isn't out to the same length as these. I'm going to let that get out to that. It'll be stimulated by that pinching process. Once this elongates, I'm going to have to come back and pinch this tree again. Two or three times across the spring season to really get a refined set of growth on a redwood is very standard for the pinching process. However, the first pinch that we do is going to set the tone for every supplemental pinch after that. So, anything that we pinch now stimulates the medium buds. Any of the medium buds that we pinch the second time stimulate the weaker buds. Some of those will elongate to a point where we need to pinch. Some of them will not. Okay? So, I'm holding back any of these very strong elongated areas. I'm going to be holding back on some of the medium strength buds if they're not out to the silhouette. But, when we see in here now, I pinched off the two stronger ones. The medium bud is actually at the exterior of that silhouette. I'm just going to go ahead and notice how I pinched these stronger ones back, but I left the medium length bud or the medium strength bud with a few more needles on it. I'm going to do the same with these medium strength buds that sit below it. I'm not going to pinch as much off because to get them out to this silhouette and to establish this shape, I need to be leaving more of that foliage mass. So, I'm always thinking about how much growth do I want? Where am I trying to get that growth? How do I continue to maintain the shape of this tree, redirect that growth, stimulate ramification and also aesthetically evolve that location in the tree? When we think and we talk about the pinching process and when we think and we talk about growth management, so much of our brain goes to the horticulture of it that a lot of times we lose the aesthetic consideration of what are we trying to accomplish. Okay? Now, redwoods being as vigorous as they are oftentimes have pieces that will be growing off of the bottom. At the same time. So, while we're here pinching, in order to not incite and encourage growth to be elongating off of the bottom of the branches, we just want to come back in and trim those pieces of growth and remove those bottom growing pieces. Okay, so one of the things that I'm consistently thinking about as I'm pinching is always trying to conceptualize how I maintain interior branches and exterior branches. We have these branches that form the exterior of our system. The exterior of our silhouette and form the shape of that pad. We have these interior pieces that are giving us that sort of contour and that body to the branch and a lot of times what happens is we'll pinch that exterior, we'll let everything on the interior grow to the exterior and we lose that body and we lose that interior ramification. So, I'm balancing and juggling all of these things at once as I'm providing sort of this pinching operation to this tree at this time. The other thing I need to be considering as well are branches that are starting to open up. Do they overlap lower branches where we're building up multiple layers in a pad or we're setting other branches on top of branches to give us a little bit more structure? Okay, in this instance I don't want these interior branches to be growing over the bulk of this pad. I want to be holding those back as well. Just the same as I'm reducing and holding back and refining the ramification in this piece not being a major piece that's giving me flow, asymmetry, direction, etc. I'm also looking at this and trying to conceptualize how to in fact make this a better interior pad that also develops the same level of refinement and ramification without suffocating or cutting down on photosynthesis of the pad that's creating that multi-tiered effect or body too. Last, as I'm doing this process, a lot of times when we start talking about interior branches potentially not having the same amount of strength as exterior branches, for a redwood, when we start designing redwood, if interior branches are weaker, obviously in most species allowing them to grow and allowing them to accumulate strength is the way that we mitigate that weakening. However, with a redwood, because if we let it grow we have no control of where the ramification is going to occur. If we cut the branch, we have no real predictability of where our budding is going to exist. We lose all of the ability to allow rapid elongation and strengthening and then be able to cut back and build from that point. We still want to be pinching those new pieces of growth but that weakening may be speaking more to a necessity to change orientation of the tree so that those weaker interior pieces are south-facing and gain strength or reconceptualizing the functionality of our design so the pieces that are existing above the weaker pieces we prioritize which one is more important in the design and we either eliminate that resistance to photosynthesis by removing that upper piece or maybe we conceptualize that smaller interior piece that's struggling as not being as effective in that location and potentially enhancing the functionality of the design by possibly removing that. So we're always looking, redwood is a real tweak on our concept of how we manage and balance strength based on how we create that ramification via pinching how we expand the foliage mass on a branch via pinching how we start to increase girth and control strength across the tree with that pinching because we're now looking at pinching as being a prioritized technique that we're applying in the development and the refinement stages of a redwood and we're looking at the functionality of our design enabling strength to exist and create that quality across the entirety of the tree so I'm going to keep pinching this lower section and just walk you guys through the dialogue and then I'm just going to kind of take off and handle the redwood you guys can watch the process you can see if there's any positions of note that I need to point out I'll stop, we'll focus on it and I'll walk you through it but this process is a very very beautiful process and a huge design element we talk about this horticulturally we also talk about this in regards to design so let's take a little bit of a further look and then I'll dive in okay so when I start to look at this interior branch here that's providing body I have a little bit of an outlier here I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to keep that outlier and I'm going to pinch that outlier to stimulate these two interior pieces to get out to this silhouette you'll notice on the interior here I don't have any branching and I'm not really necessarily concerned about having branching here because if this pad rounds out out at this exterior tip by stimulating via the pinching of that strong the two weaker pieces to come out to this point we accomplish the content and the density while also adding design quality with a secondary pad so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to pinch this exterior tip so it doesn't grow out over that pad and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to leave some of these weaker pieces I might even leave this lower growing piece here let it further reach out and then I'll just pinch the tip of that when I achieve the length that I want and even inside of this sub pad I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to pinch off these interior pieces to keep that nice and tight and keep that ramification super solidified in that area now when I come around to this side we'll notice that we have far less strong shoots here that doesn't mean that we don't pinch those this isn't a Japanese black pine this isn't something where we're saying oh it's weaker so we better let it grow we need to consistently be pinching to manage that length and driving that growth back into the interior ramification these interior pieces here because redwoods are really geared and designed to elongate they want to elongate, they want to get out to light they want to get to the canopy some of the weakest pieces can elongate the fastest and the quickest to get out to that canopy without ever thickening that's why the pinching process is really a developmental piece as well because what builds girth in branches is increasing photosynthetic mass not necessarily the length on the branches and we know if we prune a redwood we can't necessarily predict where those buds are going to occur at least not to the same degree we can with other species so I want to be particularly up on making sure that these interior pieces don't get too long just pinching those tips always considering the shape of that silhouette making sure that those interior pieces stay nice and small continuing to manage that growth and we want to keep tight short branches on the interior in order to be able to maintain the shape and also over the course of time in the development of this tree have branches that we're building on the interior to be able to potentially replace these exterior because even though we're pinching they are slowly getting larger and larger and larger with each flush of growth because we do have to leave that small portion of new growth each year so I handle the interiors fairly aggressively and again if we're sort of duped into based on common bonsai knowledge we've got to let interior branches grow we've got to let interior branches grow we can really create a nightmare of a situation for ourselves in terms of management over the course of time now if we're experiencing an area in the tree for example I'm right here I have this very tight nice branch here I've got beautiful interiors here that are providing body I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to pinch the tip of these just pinching the tips to bring all that silhouette right to that same point and I've got this kind of big long out outlier here that's starting to drape over this foliage mass I've kind of got this big outlier here growing vertically this is a perfect time to go ahead and come back in and remove some of those big long pieces thick pieces, overly aggressive pieces to be able to drive that growth and energy into the pieces that we want growing and remove sort of that propensity to grow from those pieces that are no longer fitting inside of our silhouette here's another one that last year was obviously sitting underneath this pad and you can see that tip was growing just as strong I can come back in I can directionally prune that and then I can pinch these two pieces of growth to the silhouette that I'm achieving here and really avoid having to apply wire really avoid once we get this kind of density we don't want to be coming back in and wiring this every time in fact the less wire we use the more effective and organic and natural and soft this image is going to feel so we want to be here really just trying to trying to control that growth and that energy and where it's being allocated so that we maintain sort of that even distribution and we maintain that interior versus exterior and we create that structure that really builds us a beautiful redwood branch there is a better time of year to be pruning either in the late winter or after this flush actually hardens off we can get into that sort of summer time come back in and do a full clean out and a ramification adjustment because where we pinch we can stimulate three or four buds to start to grow from one node and we will have to take two steps forward and one step backward with redwoods almost every season pinching, pinching, pinching controlling, controlling, controlling and then coming back in after everything hardens off and doing a formative pruning and we will come back and do that on this tree and show you that process so that you understand how we handle those situations okay, so I'm going to continue looking at interior versus exterior pinching to that outer silhouette of the branch maintaining my body pieces here so that I get that density without those growing too long and starting to overwhelm photosynthesis I'm going to take off I'm actually notice how this branch is starting to grow up I'm going to leave a few of these bottom pieces here and allow them to just elongate a little bit further before I come back in and pinch them so that they might be able to potentially contribute to the shape that's going to be taking place here I'm going to come back in and take off vertically growing shoots on the interior because they are getting quite strong being in that shaded environment triggering that mechanism I want to go ahead and I want to hold back some of these pieces over the top I'm going to keep these pieces on the interior now notice that I pinched the tip of this it's just sitting right over the top of that but I left this one this one can grow out to the silhouette and further enhance the shape of this now if I enhance the shape of this the branches back in here that exist on the interior are probably not going to be utilizable because this will shade them out these are those priorities inside of that design evolution that we start to make as we're building branches and really considering the style and design that we're looking for and that feels really nice right there and then on the interior here I'm going to keep these guys tight not allow them to elongate too much because I don't know if I want those to be taking over at all I've got a few pieces growing back towards the interior here I'm going to keep that nice and tight okay and this is really at this point this section let me go ahead and get that guy at this point this section right here is really a nice finished let me get all the all the stuff out take that guy off this is a really nice pinched section of redwood this is what it should look like and it's so beautiful when you have all this growth you say gosh I don't want to I don't want to pinch that off but the product of this pinching is increasing ramification tighter interior nodes multiple branching as a product of that pinching and so this is something that we do I'll show you the front of this you'll notice how much tighter this area looks through here compared to what we're looking at over here and we say man I love that density that's giving me maturity I want that if we're not disciplined in this process right and we grow out that exterior silhouette without feeding that interior it's very difficult because we'll have to prune back and start over again with the rebuild process this is how we maintain this is how we develop and this is how we evolve a redwood so as we get towards the top we start to deal in some of the design concepts that really make a formal upright special or mundane depending on how we handle these opportunities now because of the formal upright style as being this very upright static perpendicular line to the rim of the pot a lot of people think oh man formal uprights not very interesting and that's not true but we've got to maximize our opportunities to create that interest and when we start to talk about those opportunities the opportunities to maximize interest in formal uprights exists in the plays on length or lack thereof so if you notice as we move through this silhouette where we've been pinching we come out we move in we come back out we move in notice the depth branch providing sort of that stop gap from our eye totally leaving this space in the bottom notice how we move out and when we move in the depth branch is what gives us that push in of space before we come back out this oscillation sort of in that length of branch out and in and out and in that silhouette is what generates that interest and the movement that we typically have in the primary line in all of our other forms of play in all of our other forms of bonsai but in the formal upright with that static line this is where we achieve that kind of movement and energy and design now knowing that as I near the top of the tree I've got this point right here where both of these branches are virtually at the same sort of length and junction in the trunk and I've got to be making a decision about how I utilize this area of the tree do I want to elongate here and shorten here or do I want to elongate here and shorten here now becomes a very big concept now in order to make this decision I've also got to be looking at what does my length look like on the other side of the tree because if I have length here and I have length here and we achieve this one junction where we get these two long spots and then it necks down and goes back into the oscillation of the silhouette it creates almost like an inverse taper kind of feel in the design so as I look at this if I elongate here I have to compress here if I elongate here I have to compress here I'm going to say I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to elongate here and compress here go ahead and reduce here to go out in and then back out again down in this lower section and really build some of that dynamic but also responding to it on the other side and these decisions and aesthetics are what's guiding my pinching decisions in the upper apical canopy of the tree I'm going to keep on pinching we're going to execute these design concepts now I hope this is helping to talk through some of these things so that you guys see how much of a pivotal point pinching is in the design of your bonsai at this time of year okay so now that we've pinched this section you can see that I've left myself even a slightly more vigorous tip to this now this may be a little bit too wide when I step back and to get that far perspective of where we're at it almost feels a little bit too wide because it does create that wide point at the upper canopy and silhouette had we brought had we brought this tip out it would have competed with this when we bring this tip out it starts to fiddle around there so I'm going to make a little bit more of a subtle adjustment leaving just a little bit of that tip but having taken this back I've got that length discrepancy there I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to pull back some of this canopy length that we've gotten up in here to further maximize sort of some of the austerity of this tip this beautiful nice sleek transition and then you'll notice that this tip here is really sort of sitting out I'm going to show this in the detail cam as well this tip kind of sits out and sort of plays on this length play that we're working on here so I'm going to go ahead and I'm just going to take that one off and eliminate its presence in the whole equation so that we can really come back in here and really focus on all of the different components of that play on that silhouette that we're trying to maximize in the design of this formal upright tree okay so now the next step is to move to this other side and see how we compensate for that length over here on this other side so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to move to this other side I'll work my way across the front as I have been consistently keeping interiors in keeping exteriors long okay I want to keep this nice and compact not let it grow forward not let it grow over the front of the tree interior branches stay interior branches then I'm doing a little bit of a sort of bulk pinch of anything that's giving me growing tips up here I'm just maintaining sort of that finality of height when I come back over the course of time when I come back to improve the ramification up here I'll come back in and I'll be doing pruning back to the inner interior pieces and really dialing in this area of the tree so that we don't see so much of that pinch tip as a little bit more of a refined product this area has taken longer than any other to be able to build the density and sort of that refinement that we're looking for that's reflected in the rest of the tree because of the informality of that vertical growth and its management sort of as a strength mechanism in the creation of this bonsai okay let me take a look here oof strong strong redwood game strong redwood game okay so even up in the apical portion of the tree notice that we go out we come back in we go out we come back in we go out okay we go out to here in this right side we offset that oscillation we go out a little bit more in out in out into that depth branch and then out again we're pulling in here we're pushing out there and our pinching is facilitating the continued evolution of this aesthetic even at this stage of refinement I still have to consider each and every branch so over the course of this tree we've been able to stop the elongation to control shape as well as redirect growth from the tip to the interior we've just stimulated the creation of ramification which not only builds up branching builds up density but also allows us to build up girth in the branch by facilitating more foliar production on a tree that otherwise would elongate a significant amount before it starts to amass much foliage and inside of that we've learned that when we pinch those branches that exterior silhouette is one consideration interior body branches are another consideration and we're balancing those to create design that works and efficiently photosynthesizes so that all components of the tree have equal distribution equal balance equal strength and that gives us a very beautiful totality of image across the board as a result of the pinching process you guys are equipped to develop the best redwood you possibly can let the technique fly get a feel for it grow with your redwood evolve with your redwood pinching is a technique that you want to be referencing to accomplish all of those aesthetic tasks good luck and we'll see you guys with your fantastic redwoods you
