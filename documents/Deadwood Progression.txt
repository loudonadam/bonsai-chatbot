So coming back to junipers where that deadwood and that contrast of living and dead really form the value and that indicator of age. We have this kind of natural movement of the living tissue across deadwood which gives us that transition of highly weathered, slightly less weathered and fairly newly exposed deadwood. Now if we look at this tree in particular and contrast this or actually use this to educate us about the live stream two weeks ago when we were focused on the living vein, we see the creation of this very slender almost ribbon like deadwood moving into the living vein. Now what's actually happened here if we notice the transition of grain across this piece of deadwood, we've got the most aged and desiccated deadwood on the farthest point from that living tissue and it gets less and less aged and less and less checked and less and less grain exposed as you move towards that living vein. Now what's happened? What's happening is this living vein is continuing to die back on these exterior areas that are losing water flow through them and this living vein is continuing to thicken in this direction which is what's causing that ribbon like formation to be created. And following that desiccation of that deadwood we're able to follow where the original tree was versus now where that singular living vein is existing in that tree and track that progression of desiccation and age in the tree as it continued to realize this ribbon like shape in the mountains. Or the harsh environment that it came from.
