What's going on everybody? Circling back to these critiques and one of the things that I wanted to come back to was this notion of creating a natural design and inside of the natural design concept the redwood Sequoia sempervirens from the coastal region of California in the north, this specific iconic giant that forms the tallest tree in the world but also represents more or less a spirit sort of of that pioneering mentality that characterized the Western United States long ago and still carries forward today. Really coming back to critique a tree that I've spent a lot of time with not necessarily doing much but a lot of time with watching and learning and trying to figure out the process of how do you tease out this natural feel in material that offers the opportunity to create a natural design and to create a natural design that offers the opportunity to be just that, a representation of nature and miniature. Now when I originally styled this tree it was a very big trunk that had been kind of cut right near the top and the height of the tree was right around where my hand exists right now and even though I knew this was going to be a natural form and representation of a redwood we wired the leaders up vertically to try and give it that kind of feel. I had started by pinching and trying to refine the foliar mass of the tree. Over the course of time with the repeat of the process of refining the foliar mass of the tree over the course of time with the repeat of the process of refining the foliar mass of the tree over the course of rapidity with which redwoods grow, the vigor and strength that it had, it shot out with these new leaders and I wasn't able to get to them to cut it off and one thing that started to happen inside of that is I noticed ah the longer that gets the more natural this piece feels the more representative it feels and that height that transition of that elongated growth the proportion of the height to the thickness of the trunk was definitely something that in the initial design I hadn't clued into but I didn't also like that initial design and so I just continued to let it elongate and let it further elongate and let it further elongate and now we're at this pivotal point where we need to come back and we need to critique what makes a natural redwood how do we characterize a larger tree in the macro environment and define it in that miniaturized form and really look at the aesthetics of this tree to create a game plan and a template to move forward with its next sort of round of design in the workshop to really figure out how we refine this and pull on all of the growth in everything this tree has given us to get to that better representation of nature and miniature now let's just start out by discussing how do we create and how do we define those characteristics that exist in the larger environment and carry those into our bonsai work now when we look at a redwood we see this verticality and that verticality the proportion that gives that verticality its presence is the narrowness of the foliage mass not branching off super wide from the trunk now this concept is very contrary to the aesthetic of bonsai where we have longer branches generating flow oftentimes we try to compress the design to lower that height improve that proportion and impression of power and in doing that for a redwood at least that has the ability to be a skyscraping representation of the species that's counter to the aesthetic that actually gives them that feel of being this giant huge vertical tree in the natural environment when I look at this piece I'm almost going to keep the entirety of the verticality it's created over the course of the past two years but I recognize inside of seeing that narrow silhouette that iconicizes most redwoods that I've got too much lateral length in my branching that exists now another aspect of redwoods that I notice is that they have multiple apices reaching up towards the sky this tree's been broken off it's been burnt a little bit and it would have all of the characteristics in the natural environment that would create the multiple apicy form to take advantage of that and also utilize that secondary piece of height as another consistent reflection of that general characteristic when the apex is lost in a redwood that we would have multiple leaders trying to compete for that tallest point in the tree is reflected in this design and it's something I want to continue to work with narrowing that silhouette opening up some of that lower trunk to see that space and carrying that height forward not just of one singular apex but because we have that broken component that not so smooth sort of traumatic transition of that original apex to these multiple leaders is one of those things that we see in that natural iconic form of the redwood in that old growth forest of the Pacific coastline in Northern California that we're really trying to maximize in terms of this composition. Beyond that we talked about that visual space at the base of the trunk being able to see that tree those lowest branches in that existence of that ecosystem are oftentimes going to be shaded out or going to be working really hard to find their space and this is what forms the dropping branches in a redwood not all branches grow up not all branches become apices but a lot of the branches that do grow up have smaller pieces seeking that light by dropping way down and occupying the negative space or the available sunlight. I see that opportunity and so many of these lateral branches coming off of my vertical pieces and this is also a technique that's going to allow me to be able to narrow that silhouette and really give that vertical impression of that big grand redwood in the natural environment. Finally keeping those foliar masses small when I look at how this tree was initially styled the foliar masses are very big on these branches that we've created the pads from. This is not necessarily true to scale for what a real redwood would look like in that grand environment at that size that redwood achieve at that size that red would achieve when they're growing in the region they're native to. Seeing the ability to reduce the size of those foliar pads small foliar masses scattered throughout the wide availability of negative space utilizing those in our design to give depth to create that out in and back out again that gives interest to the silhouette. Generating that asymmetry that still gives this upright form some asymmetry and some flow to carry the interest of the viewer through our composition. These are all components that I would really like to seize take advantage of and carry from that natural rendition in its iconic environment into the miniaturized form. An abstraction to be sure of the redwood that we see when we look at that three hundred foot tall redwood but an abstraction that carries forward the spirit of that species and allows us to represent it in miniature. When you guys approach the recreation of nature in miniature each one of us is going to take a different interpretation of that larger scale tree and pull on those pieces of that tree that strikes us and that exists inside of our psyche when we come back to our bonsai studio and start working to duplicate or represent that in a miniature form and these pieces that you pull out of those trees when you're viewing that native landscape are the pieces that make your representation of that native landscape yours and yours alone. And stylistically something that is unique to the way you've filtered that image and represented it in the medium of bonsai. Embrace that capacity to interpret the native landscape. Embrace your ability to abstract that concept and bring it to life in miniature form and inside of that those pieces that you pull out of that grander theme are what's going to define that tree as a representation true to your experience and true to your interpretation of that environment and of that species. I hope this gives you a little bit of insight into the way that I'm looking at the native environment and trying to pull in those pieces that are sticking with me. They're gonna manipulate and they're gonna change through the filtration process of my memory of them but inside of that we accomplish something with our native species and the attempt to duplicate that natural form in the greater environment in this miniature medium of bonsai that is very unique to us, to our culture, to the landscape at large, into the material we have the opportunity to work with. Key into those nuances, embrace that abstraction, and let's see what's truly capable of being created when we really observe with intentionality and try to mimic that in the miniaturized form. I'm excited to see your natural abstractions and interpretations. I look forward to carrying this tree forward with everything it's given me and what I've learned about the redwood form in the natural environment. And the future looks bright for all of the opportunities that are presented to us to recreate nature in miniature through the medium of bonsai. Thank you.
